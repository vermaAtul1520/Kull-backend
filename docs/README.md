communityId: YOUR_COMMUNITY_ID
userId: YOUR_USER_ID
```

### 3. Test Authentication
```bash
POST {{baseUrl}}/auth/login
Body:
{
  "emailOrPhone": "user@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}

# Copy the token from response and update collection variable
```

### 4. Start Making Requests
All other requests in the collection use the `{{token}}` variable automatically!

```

### 2. **Appeals System (Open to All Users)**
- ANY authenticated user can submit appeals
- No admin permission required
- Automatically linked to user's community
- Role-based filtering on list endpoint

**Example:**
```bash

}
# Works for all users with a community!
```

### 3. **News Headlines Endpoint**
- Dedicated endpoint for homepage news slider

## üß™ Testing Guide

### Test with cURL

**1. Login:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"emailOrPhone":"user@example.com","password":"pass"}'
```

**2. Use Token:**
```bash
TOKEN="your_jwt_token_here"

curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/users/pending \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**3. Create User with Password:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/communities/COMMUNITY_ID/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName":"Test",
    "lastName":"User",
    "email":"test@example.com",
    "password":"TestPass123"
  }'
```

**4. View Passwords (Admin):**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/communities/COMMUNITY_ID/users?projection=firstName,email,password" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## üìä Common Patterns

### Query Parser Syntax
```
# Filter
?filter[field]=value
?filter[status]=active&filter[gender]=male

# Sort
?sort=firstName          # Ascending
?sort=-createdAt        # Descending

# Pagination
?limit=20&page=1

# Projection
?projection=firstName,email,phone

# Combined
?filter[gender]=male&sort=firstName&limit=50&projection=firstName,email,password
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "total": 100,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 20,
  "count": 20,
  "data": [...]
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Password Visibility
- **Stored in plain text** for admin viewing
- **Also hashed** with bcrypt for authentication
- **Only visible to admins** via projection
- **Not auto-included** in queries

### Breaking Changes from v2.0
- ‚ùå Removed route aliases (`/api/employment`, etc.)
- ‚ùå Removed dedicated password endpoint
- ‚úÖ Use user list endpoint with projection instead
- ‚úÖ SuperAdmins now have full news access

### Security Best Practices
1. Always use HTTPS in production
2. Rotate JWT secrets regularly
3. Monitor admin access logs
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Use strong passwords
6. Enable database encryption at rest

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**401 Unauthorized:**
- Check if token is valid
- Ensure token is not expired
- Verify Authorization header format

**403 Forbidden:**
- Check user role and permissions
- Verify community ownership for Community Admins
- Ensure user belongs to a community (for appeals)

**404 Not Found:**
- Verify endpoint URL is correct
- Check if route aliases were removed (use full paths)
- Ensure resource ID exists

**Password Not Visible:**
- Ensure you're using admin token
- Include `password` in projection query
- Check if user has `plainTextPassword` field
